This project involves cleaning a real-world dataset of scraped salad data to prepare it for analysis.

We will go through the data cleaning process step by step, sharing the mindset and reasoning behind each decision we make along the way.

## Project Overview

## Files Included

- `messy_data.csv` — original raw dataset
- `cleaned_data.csv` — final cleaned dataset ready for analysis
- `data_cleaning.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with step-by-step cleaning process
- `requirements.txt` — Python libraries needed to run the notebook
